# SlimLoader

## ‚ùì What is it?
SlimLoader is a lightweight `sideloader` for automotive (Android Auto) applications.

## ‚ùì Why would I need it?
AA doesn't let people install custom apps, you can only install certain authorized apps such as Spotify, Youtube Music, Google Maps, ...

## ‚ùì How does it work?
The app pretends to be a "certified installer" and AA believes it

## üî• How to operate:
Once installed, the application will ask for two separate permissions:
 - Access external files: by default android apps can only access their files
 - Trust as unknown app installation source: every application which installs APKs needs this permission

After giving the app it's permissions, just click the `Choose APK` button.

At this point the app lets the user select an APK file, as soon as the user selects it, the installation begins!
